# Site #

A site is the next level below a [System](System.md) for managing a set of  [channels](Channel.md).  Use a different site for each trunked radio tower location, or to organize a collection of related channels.

When a [Channel](Channel.md) within the [Site](Site.md) is actively decoding, the system icon is colored Green.
