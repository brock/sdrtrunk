# Activity Summary #

The activity summary window displays a summary of information about network, frequency, call and user activity received.  The format of the activity summary is different for each decoder.

If you are using [auxiliary decoders](AuxiliaryDecoder.md), then the activity summary for each of those auxiliary decoders is included at the end of the primary decoder activity summary.
